Implementations of various algorithms in Python and Java. For fun. Do I need to get out more?

Some Java classes that involve graphs (e.g. ```BinarySearchTree.java```) have solutions to exercises from the Sedgwick "Algorithms" book.

They generate output in ```.dot``` format.

Run the following command to generate a pictorial graph PS image. which you can then open and view at your leisure:

    dot -Tps graph.dot -o graph.ps
    
You'll need to install GraphViz first though.
